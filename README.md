# Welcome!

Intrigue Core is a framework for discovering attack surface. It discovers security-relevant assets and exposures within the context of projects and can be used with a human-in-the-loop running individual tasks, and/or automated through the use of workflows. With a flexible entity model and an incredibly deep enrichment system, it is the most full-featured attack surface discovery framework of its kind.

# Getting Started... for Users

To get started quickly and play around with an instance of Core, head on over to the [Getting Started Guide](https://core.intrigue.io/getting-started/). We suggest the Docker image as a first place to start. It's actively built on the main branch of Intrigue Core. An image build on our unstable branch (develop) is also available if you're interested in testing the latest and greatest.

# Getting Started... for Developers

To get started setting up a development environment, follow the instructions below:

While you can build a local setup on any OSX or \*nix system, we'd suggest starting with our Vagrant setup guide: http://core.intrigue.io/getting-started-with-intrigue-core-on-vagrant-virtualbox/

You'll  want to take a look at the following resources to better understand the system:
