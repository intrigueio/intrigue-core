    #          (HTTP)  This  lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388. This enables uploading of binary files
    #          etc. To force the 'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the symbol <. The difference between @ and < is then that @ makes a  file  get
    #          attached in the post as a file upload, while the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text field from a file.
