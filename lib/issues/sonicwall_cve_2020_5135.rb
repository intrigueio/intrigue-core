        description: "CVE-2020-5135 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the VPN Portal of SonicWallâ€™s Network Security Appliance. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a custom protocol handler to a vulnerable device. At a minimum, successful exploitation would result in a denial of service condition against the exploited device, exhausting its resources. Remote code execution is likely feasible with additional footwork.",
