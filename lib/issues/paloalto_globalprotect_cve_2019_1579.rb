        description: "A known format string vulnerability in the PAN SSL Gateway was discovered, which handles client/server SSL handshakes. More specifically, the vulnerability exists because the gateway passes the value of a particular parameter to snprintf in an unsanitized, and exploitable, fashion. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable SSL VPN target in order to remotely execute code on the system.",
