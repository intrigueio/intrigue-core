        description: "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in IceWarp Webmail Server through 11.4.4.1. An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.",
